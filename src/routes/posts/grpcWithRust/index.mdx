# A short journey into gRPC with Rust

I use `tokio` and `seaORM` to build a simple CRUD gRPC app. Here is what I got from the process.

## Trait or not trait?

I'm a big fan of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and coming from a background of `go`, when I think of using `rust` to write a gRPC service, I came up with the following folder structure in `/src`:

```
/controller
/entity
/repository
/usecase
main.rs
controller.rs
repository.rs
usecase.rs
```

For example, the `usecase.rs` file contains the trait `UseCase` and its implementation `UseCaseState`. Although the trait `UseCase` only has 1 implementation, I like to keep it as a trait for clearly showing all the interfaces of `UseCase`.

And at first I think I can do static dispatching with all the performance gain.

The final code of `usecase.rs` looks like this:

```rust
use crate::repository::Repository;
use anyhow::Result;
use async_trait::async_trait;

mod delete;
mod get;
mod update;

#[async_trait]
pub trait UseCase {
	//get something
    async fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<String>;
	//update something
    async fn update(&self, k: &str, v: &str) -> Result<()>;
	//delete something
    async fn delete(&self, k: &str) -> Result<()>;
}

pub struct UseCaseState<Repository> {
    repo: Repository,
}

impl<T: Repository> UseCaseState<T> {
    pub async fn new(repo: T) -> Self {
        UseCaseState { repo, client }
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl<T> UseCase for UseCaseState<T>
where
    T: Repository + Sync + Send,
{
    async fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Result<String> {
        Ok(self.get_uc(key).await?)
    }

    async fn update(&self, k: &str, v: &str) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(self.update_uc(k, v).await?)
    }
    async fn delete(&self, k: &str) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(self.delete_uc(k).await?)
    }
}
```

I want to make the code more readable, so I separate the `UseCase` implementation into multiple files in `/usecase` folder, containing the `get_uc`, `update_uc` and `delete_uc` functions. You can see them from the three `mod` lines at the beginning.

I must say this results in a lot of boilerplate code.

And I am only a beginner of `rust`, it is not pleasant to write the trait bounds and lifetime specifier for generic in trait implementation.

And the final docker image size is about `140Mb`.

So I told myself maybe I can remove all the `static dispatching` and `async_trait` stuff. I can tell after removing `trait` and `generic`, the code becomes much cleaner and the final docker image size is only about `60Mb`, almost halving the build size.

The code without trait:

```rust
use crate::repository::RepositoryState;

mod delete;
mod get;
mod update;

pub struct UseCaseState {
    repo: RepositoryState,
}

impl UseCaseState {
    pub async fn new(repo: RepositoryState) -> Self {
        UseCaseState { repo, client }
    }
}
```

I also tried `dynamic dispatching`, with some struggle on the trait bound and lifetime(no surprise). Comparing the build size, it's almost identical to the image with no trait(with no surprise again).

To me, I can see no benefits of using trait(especially static dispatching) with only 1 implementation. I think now I can only rely on my IDE to check all the implementations of a struct.

## Tiny problems with Rust Analyzer and VSCode

- code navigation

When generating `rust` code from `proto` file, I utilize `tonic` with `build.rs`. The default location for the generated code will be somewhere like `target/debug/build/your_project_name-xxxxxxx/out/proto_package_name.rs`.

Since I'm a beginner at `rust`, I have the urge to look at the generated code, but `rust analyzer` will disappoint me as it always directs me to the `include!` clause. As stated in this [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/3767). (+1 for `CLion`)

- code completion

`rust analyzer` can't auto-implement missing members of an async trait. Check this [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/13595). (+1 for `CLion`)

## Interceptors

I can't find any ecosystem of interceptors like [`go-grpc-middleware`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware). Although there are some crates providing functions for `tracing` and `metrics`, I think they are not ready to use like the `go` version above.

In a use case, I want to check multiple metadata in the request. I come up with some code like this:

```rust
pub struct MyExtension {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub user_name: String,
}

pub fn unary_interceptor(mut req: Request<()>) -> Result<Request<()>, Status> {
    let m = req.metadata().clone();
    req.extensions_mut().insert(MyExtension {
        user_id: m
            .get("user-id")
            .unwrap_or_status_err(Status::internal("user-id is missing"))?
            .to_str()
            .unwrap_or_status_err(Status::internal("user-id is invalid"))?
            .to_string(),
        user_name: m
            .get("user-name")
            .unwrap_or_status_err(Status::internal("user-name is missing"))?
            .to_str()
            .unwrap_or_status_err(Status::internal("user-name is invalid"))?
            .to_string(),
    });

    Ok(req)
}

trait UnwrapOrErr<T> {
    fn unwrap_or_status_err(self, err: Status) -> Result<T, Status>;
}

impl<T> UnwrapOrErr<T> for Option<T> {
    fn unwrap_or_status_err(self, err: Status) -> Result<T, Status> {
        match self {
            Some(val) => Ok(val),
            None => return Err(err),
        }
    }
}

impl<T, E> UnwrapOrErr<T> for Result<T, E>
where
    E: fmt::Debug,
{
    fn unwrap_or_status_err(self, err: Status) -> Result<T, Status> {
        match self {
            Ok(val) => Ok(val),
            Err(e) => {
                log::error!("{:?}", e);
                return Err(err);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As for logging, I use the tonic [tower example](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/blob/master/examples/src/tower/server.rs) to add a logging middleware.

## Conclusion

I like `rust`, the `type` system is powerful, `async` is fun to learn, `log` is pleasant to use.

But when I write `rust`, I must think about the program itself(like the borrowing rule) and the business logic, when I write `go`, business logic is all I need to concern about. Maybe it's just I'm a beginner at `rust`, but the ecosystem will be my first thing to check next time I'm thinking about using `rust` in a gRPC service.
