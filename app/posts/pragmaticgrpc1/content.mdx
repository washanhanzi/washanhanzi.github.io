## `.proto` file

Below are some useful tips to write your proto definition.

In `.proto`:

- The `package` field should contain version infomation, like `HelloService.v1`
- The request and response message should name with a certain rule, generally it
  will be the the service rpc method name with a `Request` or `Response` suffix.
  Like:

```
rpc HelloWorld(HelloWorldRequest) returns (HelloWorldResponse){}
```

A good place to start is
[Goole API design guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design).

Just keep in mind, protocol buffer, like `go`, always have a default
value, it can't differentiating unset value from default value. As an example, always keep `0` as the
unkown or unset value for `enum` (you should do it in `go` either, always start
from `iota+1`):

```
enum Hello {Â 
	UNKNOWN = 0;
	STARTED = 1;
	RUNNING = 1;
}
```

### Struct first or Proto first?

1. Struct first

There are some packages will generate `proto` definition from your `struct`
type. Personaly I didn't try them out. The benifit of this approch is appealing,
especially you use an ORM like `gorm`. The `struct` will generate all the things
you need, and it become your only source of truth.

I think this approach is poorly
[supported](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57064482/how-to-cast-convert-a-struct-to-protobuf).
Generally, I preper to write `.proto` file first, it's really easy to use
`.proto` file to work with the front end or other back end service team to
finalize the API.

2. Proto first

With all the code generated from your `.proto` file, there is a tendency to
think `.proto` file as your source of truth. Don't. The `.proto` file mostly
belong to the `controller`, it shouldn't coupled with your bussiness logic or
database interactions.

The problem is you can't easily cast your `struct` type to `.proto` generated
`struct` type (the `proto.Message` type). The generated type have some addional
fields. An easy solution is to use the `gogofaster` binary of
[gogoprotobuf](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf), like:

```
protoc --proto_path proto  --gogofaster_out="plugins=grpc:." ./proto/*.proto
```

This package provides lots of extentions to custimize the
`[golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf)`. Like the support of
golang data type and marshaller function.

The problem is the helpful library is
[looing for new ownership](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/issues/691), and it
didn't support the new version of go protocol buffer api.

Go have two version of protocol buffer libriry,
[v1](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf) and
[v2](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf). The newer version have many
improvements like the [reflection api](https://blog.golang.org/protobuf-apiv2).

If you want to start a new project with gRPC, I suggest start with v2 api. Then
you have 2 choices to cast your `struct` type to the generated type.

1. Serillize and desrillize. Make sure you use the right library:
   `google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson`.
2. Write some boilerplate code by your own. (or you want to do it with code
   generation?)

I think the only thing to consider is performance, just benchmark with your own
proto message you will come to a conclusion. Generally, I prefer the second one.

### code generation

With the newly v2 api, here is an example how to generate go code from `.proto`
file.

```
protoc -I=proto --go\_out\=module\=github.com/hello/hello:. \
--go-grpc_out=module=github.com/hello/hello:. \
./proto/\*.proto
```

In every `.proto` file, add a line to specify the
[go module](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/releases#v1.21-generator):
`option go\_package \= "github.com/hello/hello/yourModule/pb";`

And the generated code will be put into the `pb` folder under every specific
module.

## Error

In `restful api`, sometimes people put error code and error message in every response (which is a bad practice). Don't do that in gRPC. gRPC error can contain the error code and the error message. If you got a response with code `ok`, then it indicate the request is `successful(?)`. To construct an gRPC error is really simple:

```
status.Error(codes.Internal, "request failed")
```

You can check the gRPC error type with:

```
//"google.golang.org/grpc/status"

if se, ok := status.FromError(err);ok {
	return se.Err()
}
```

You can read more about the gRPC error code and examplanation
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes).

For all the error codes, your application should only consider return these:

```
InvalidArgument [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 3
NotFound [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 5
AlreadyExists [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 6
PermissionDenied [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 7
FailedPrecondition [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 9
Aborted [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 10
OutOfRange [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 11
DataLoss [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 15
Unauthenticated [Code](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/codes#Code) = 16
```

If you want dig more into the gRPC error, I suggest to watch this
[vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zR3cyC-I&t=512s).

## Deadline

It's best practice to use deadlines.

You can check whether client set a deadline:

```
d,ok := ctx.Deadline()
if !ok {
	//return some error
}
timeout := d.Sub(time.Now())
//check timeout range
if timeout < 5*time.Second || timeout > 30*time.Second {
	//return some error
}
```

But, for all the gRPC and `gRPC-web` libraries among all the languages, I don't
think every one of them will let you set deadlines in client request. Just think
twice to implement this check on your service.

You can check for more about deadline propagation in this
[vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_yD7YPL2oE&list=FL_F0hJOcLaFNDptQDkcoSQA&index=3)
(and other best practices).

## Interceptor and Metadata

Interceptor is like the `middleware` in `REST` framework. You can get all your
need from [this repo](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware). The
interceptor chain just works like middleware chain in `REST` framework.

Almost in every `REST` framework, you can define a specific middleware for a
specific controller or endpoint. Unfortuanately, I haven't found an easy way to
do this in `gRPC`, you can only write interceptor for the whole server, after
that, you can filter your routes in interceptor, or you can put the code
directly in the `controller`.

Metadata in gRPC is the HTTP/2 version of http headers. You can find a detailed explanation
[here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/Documentation/grpc-metadata.md).

A lot of things can be done with interceptors using metadata and context, like
authentication and authorization.

To read data from metadata is easy:

```
md, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)
if !ok {
    //return some error
}
```

`md` is of type `metadata.MD` which is `map[string][]string`. For example, to
get the trace id:

```
IDs, ok := md["x-b3-traceid"]
```

This solved part of our problem, to read data from request. If you want to pass
some data to other interceptor or `controller`, you can use `context`.

```
type key int

//payloadKey is unexported, to prevent collisions with keys defined in other packages
var payloadKey key

//Payload is a custom struct contain the data you want to pass on
type Payload struct {
    ID string
}
```

First, we need an unexported type `payloadKey` as an unique identifier, which
won't be overwrite by other code or packages like an ordinary metadata name.

```
//newContext will create a new go `context` with the payload
func newContext(ctx context.Context, payload *Payload) context.Context {
    return context.WithValue(ctx, payloadKey, payload)
}
```

```
//FromContext can be used in all controllers to get the payload from `context`
func FromContext(ctx context.Context) (*Payload, bool) {
	payload, ok := ctx.Value(payloadKey).(*MetaPayload)
	return payload, ok
}
```

Combine with the above `interceptor chain`:

```
func UnaryInterceptor() grpc.UnaryServerInterceptor {
 	return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (interface{}, error) {
	//read data from metadata
	...
	//construct your payload
	...
	//return the new `context`
	return handler(newContext(ctx, &payload),req)
}
```

That's only the case for unary interceptor, for stream interceptor, we can still
use the unexported`payloadKey`and`FromContext`, but we need a wrapped stream.

```
//WrappedStream implement the grpc stream interface, but we need to modify the Context() method to return our new context with payload
type WrappedStream interface {
	grpc.ServerStream
	Context() context.Context
}

type wrappedStream struct {
	grpc.ServerStream
	parentCtx context.Context
	payload   *Payload
}

func newWrappedStream(ss grpc.ServerStream, payload *Payload) *wrappedStream {
 	return &wrappedStream{ss, ss.Context(), payload}
}

//Context() will return our context with payload
func (w *wrappedStream) Context() context.Context {
    return context.WithValue(w.parentCtx, payloadKey, w.payload)
}
```

In this way, we utilize go's composition power, you don't need to modify any
existing code.

```
func StreamInterceptor() grpc.StreamServerInterceptor {
	return func(srv interface{}, ss grpc.ServerStream, info *grpc.StreamServerInfo, handler grpc.StreamHandler) error {
	//some code
	...
	return handler(srv,newWrappedStream(ss, &payload))
}
```

With all the above, you can easily implement your own authentication and
authorization logic.

But there is a problem, in `REST`, the request headers, url and method generally
contain all the information you need for authorization, the `authorization`
header will contain information about the user identity, the url will tell you
which resource user requested, and the method is the user action. In gRPC, you
still get the `authorization` metadata, you can get user action from:

```
//The FullMethod will return a string contain gRPC package, service, rpc method
//Remember the gRPC package is versioned? make sure update the gRPC package version won't break your authorization code
info.FullMethod
```

But you will not have any information about what resources user requested. Then,
you need to put that information in the metadata if you want to do the
authorization in interceptor. Or you will put the request resouces in request
message.

I prefer the first approach, but carefully design your api, as data related to
your bussiness logic is now in metadata and request message.

## Partial Update

gRPC use a `google.protobuf.FieldMask` to describe
[partial update](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#partial_response).

You can utilize reflect api in v2 to deal with the `FieldMask`:

```
//check field mask exsistence
if request.FieldMask != nil{
	request.FieldMask.Normalize()
	//check if the field mask is valid
	if ok:=request.FieldMaks.IsValid(request); !ok{
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid field mask")
	}
}
paths:=request.FieldMask.GetPaths()

//the rest is on your own, you can do whatever you what with paths

//for example, you can do partial update by your own without reflection since fv.(type) is realy annoying
//notice the protocol buffer `[list](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect#List)` and `[map](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect#List)` type is not same as the go `array` or `map` type.
rft := request.ProtoReflect()
rft.Range(func(fd protoreflect.FieldDescriptor, fv protoreflect.Value) bool {
	//compare fd.JSONName() to the maskPaths value
	//get corresponse field value with fv.(type)
}
```

## Stream with Broadcast

The most excitment part about gRPC of couse is its streaming ability. Though
it's no easy feat to implement that for beginners of concurrency programming
(like me). I hope I can ease your pain when implenting the gRPC streaming with
broadcast.

The basic here are:

- Each handler runs in its own goroutine (each connection will have its own
  goroutine)

As documented in
[Concurrency](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/Documentation/concurrency.md#servers):

> Each RPC handler attached to a registered server will be invoked in its own
> goroutine. For example,
> [SayHello](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/helloworld/greeter_server/main.go#L41)
> will be invoked in its own goroutine. The same is true for service handlers
> for streaming RPCs, as seen in the route guide example
> [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/route_guide/server/server.go#L126).
> Similar to clients, multiple services can be registered to the same server.

- `chan` is not build for broadcast, it's one to one communication

You will end up with some thing like `map[string]chan`, the `string` is an
identifier to identify the goroutin (client connection), like a `sessionID`, or
`tracingID`, or a random string, or `userID` (pay attention! only when you can
be sure the user can only login to one instance, that is each user can only have
a single active connetion, or the above `map` becomes to
`map[userID]map[connectionID]chan`). The `chan` is created in the `controller`
indicating the exact goroutine (connetion) which will receive message from, and
the `controller` will pass the received message to client.

Here is an over simplified code:

```
func (s *server) Subscribe(req *pb.SubscribeRequest, srv pb.SubscribeServer) error {
	//get trace id or generated a random string or whatever you want to indicate this goroutine
	ID:="randomString"
	//create a chan to receive response message
	conn := make(chan *pb.SubscribeResponse)
	for {
		//receive message
		response:=<-conn
		//send to client
		srv.Send(response)
	}
}
```

Below are some approaches I saw or I can think of:

1. Sharing `srv`

This will avoid this `map` structure or maybe all the `channel` things.

```
func (s *server) TestHandler(req *pb.TestRequest, srv pb.TestServer) error {
	...
}
```

For a server streaming handler above, you can share the `srv` between
goroutines. The rest is up to you, you can put the `srv` in a `map` or `slice`
based on what you want. Just be careful as documented in
[Streams](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/Documentation/concurrency.md#streams):

> When using streams, one must take care to avoid calling either `SendMsg` or
> `RecvMsg` multiple times against the same
> [Stream](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#Stream) from different
> goroutines. In other words, it's safe to have a goroutine calling `SendMsg`
> and another goroutine calling `RecvMsg` on the same stream at the same time.
> But it is not safe to call `SendMsg` on the same stream in different
> goroutines, or to call `RecvMsg` on the same stream in different goroutines.

And you certainly need `sync.Mutex`, I will talk about it later.

I personally don't like this approach, it will cause problems said above, and
why not channels ?

2. Sharing `map`

With the `map` structure previously metioned, at some point you always want to
modify the `map` structure in another goroutine. For example, you want to access
the `map` and send message to the `chan` in one goroutine, and you want to add
new connections or remove connections from the `map` in other goroutine, then it
comes to the `sync.Mutex`, just beware of dead locks.

```
mu.Lock()
	doSomething()
	mu.Unlock()
```

If `mu` is a `sync.Mutex` lock, always `Lock()` and `Unlock()` in the outer
function, do not `Lock()` and `Unlock` in `doSomething()`, as your code become
complicated, you will not notice when you `Lock()` twice.

This approch is also sharing memory, and it prone to deadlocks. As said in [##
[Share Memory By Communicating](https://blog.golang.org/codelab-share)](https://blog.golang.org/codelab-share)

> Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.

Thus comes the third approch.

### 3. An intermediate Channel

We can have an interemediate goroutine which have the ownership of the `map`
structure, by ownership I mean only this goroutine can modify the `map`
structure. Message will be send to a intermediate channel `Broadcast`, and the
`Broadcast` will modify the `map` structure, or send message to `channel`
according to the identifier. The `Broadcast` have the ownership of the `map`
structure, and the data flows in a single direction.

Some code you can work with:

```
func (s *server) Subscribe(req *pb.SubscribeRequest, srv pb.SubscribeServer) error {
	//get trace id or generated a random string or whatever you want to indicate this goroutine
	ID:="randomString"
	//create a chan to receive response message
	conn := make(chan *pb.SubscribeResponse)
	//an intermediate channel which incharge of the `map`
	s.broadcast <- &broadcastPayload {
		//an unique identifier
		ID: ID
		//the chan corresponse to the ID
		Conn: conn
		//event to indicate add, remove or send message to broadcast channel
		Event: EventEnum.AddConnection
	}

	for {
		select {
			case <-srv.Context().Done():
				s.broadcast <- &entity.BroadcastPayload{
					 ID: ID,
					 Event: EventEnum.RemoveConnection
				}
				return nil
			case response := <-conn:
				if status, ok := status.FromError(srv.Send(response)); ok {
					switch status.Code() {
					case codes.OK:
						//noop
					case codes.Unavailable, codes.Canceled, codes.DeadlineExceeded:
						return nil
					default:
						return nil
			 }
		 }}
	}
}
```

```
//this goroutine has the ownership of the map[string]chan *pb.SubscribeResponse
go func(){
	for v:=range s.broadcast {
		//do something based on the event
		switch v.Event {
			//add the ID and conn to the map
			case EventEnum.AddConnection:
				...
			case EventEnum.RemoveConnection:
				...
			//receive message from bussiness logic, send the message to suiteable conn in the map as you like
			case EventEnum.ReceiveResponse:
				...
		}
	}
}
```

4. Maybe a counter?

Without a `map` to identify the single `chan` used by the single connection,
another approach I saw online is to use a counter. The counter will record the
number of connections by a single `user` or a custom`subject`, the single `user`
or `subject` will share a `chan`(comparing to the above, each connection use a
singe `chan`), you can use the `sync.Mutex` or `sync/atomic` to modify the
counter when new connection comes in or drop out. The counter will decide how
many times you want to send to the `chan`.

5. sync.Cond

If the usecase is really simple, I think `sync.Cond` is also a valid approach,
but myself never tries this.

Personally I prefer the 3rd approach, it avoid memory sharing and the code is
cleaner.

6. Going distributed

If you want to use a messaging system, like `kafka` or `NATS`, you just need to change the code in the intermediate `broadcast` channel, or you won't need to consider all the problems above.
